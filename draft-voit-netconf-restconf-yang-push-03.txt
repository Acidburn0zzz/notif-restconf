1.  Introduction

   Mechanisms to support Event subscription and push are defined in
   [rfc5277bis].  Enhancements to [rfc5277bis] which enable YANG
   Datastore subscription and push are defined in [yang-push].  This
   document provides a transport specification for these Restconf and
   HTTP.  This has been driven by Requirements for subscriptions to YANG
   datastores are defined in [pub-sub-reqs].

   Beyond based transport bindings, there are benefits which can be
   realized when transporting updates directly HTTP/2[RFC7540] which cn
   be realized via an implementation of this transport specification
   including:

   o  Subscription multiplexing over independent HTTP/2 streams

   o  Stream prioritization and stream dependencies

   o  Flow control on independent streams

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   individual data items represented by data nodes which are arranged in
   hierarchical manner.

   Dynamic Subscription: a Subscription negotiated between Subscriber
   and Publisher via create, establish, modify, and delete RPC control
   plane signaling messages.

   Publisher: an entity responsible for distributing subscribed YANG
   object data per the terms of a Subscription.  In general, a Publisher
   is the owner of the YANG datastore that is subjected to the
   Subscription.

   Receiver: a target to which a Publisher pushes updates.  In many
   deployments, the Receiver and Subscriber will be the same entity.

   Configured Subscription: A Subscription installed via a configuration
   interface.

   Subscriber: an entity able to request and negotiate a contract for
   push updates from a Publisher.

   Subscription: a contract between a Subscriber and a Publisher,
   stipulating which information the Receiver wishes to have pushed from
   the Publisher without the need for further solicitation.

   Subscription Update: a set of data nodes and object values pushed
   together as a unit and intended to meet the obligations of a single
   subscription at a snapshot in time.

3.  Solution

   Event subscription is defined in [rfc5277bis], YANG Datastore
   subscription is defined in [yang-push].  This section specifies
   transport mechanisms applicable to both.

3.1.  Mechanisms for Subscription Establishment and Maintenance

   There are three models for Subscription establishment and
   maintenance:

   1.  Dynamic Subscription: Here the Subscriber and Receiver are the
       same.  A Subscription ends with a subscription-terminated
       notification, or by a loss of transport connectivity.

   2.  Configured Subscription: Receiver(s) are specified on Publisher
       in startup and running config.  Subscription is not Terminated
       except via an operations interface.  (Subscriptions may be
       Suspended, and no notifications sent however.)

Internet-Draft                Restconf Push                   March 2016


   3.  Proxy Subscription: Subscriber and Receiver are different.
       Subscription ends when a Subscription End-time is reached, or the
       Publisher process is restarted.

   The first two are described in this section.  The third is described
   in Appendix A.  This third option can be moved into the body of this
   specification should the IETF community desire.  In theory, all three
   models may be intermixed in a single deployment.

3.1.1.  Dynamic YANG Subscription over RESTCONF

   Dynamic Subscriptions are configured and manage Subscriptions via
   signaling.  This signaling is transported over [restconf].  Once
   established, streaming Subscription Updates are then delivered via
   Restconf SSE.

3.1.2.  Configured Subscription over HTTP

   With a Configured Subscription, all information needed to establish a
   secure object push relationship with that Receiver is configured on
   the Publisher.  With this information, the Publisher will establish a
   secure transport connection with the Receiver and then begin pushing
   the streaming updates to the Receiver.  Since Restconf might not
   exist on the Receiver, it is not desirable to require that updates be
   pushed via Restconf.  Nor is there value which Restconf provides on
   top of HTTP.  Therefore in place of Restconf, a TLS secured HTTP
   Client connection must be established with an HTTP Server located on
   the Receiver.  Subscription Updates will then be sent via HTTP Post
   messages to the Receiver.

   Post messages will be addressed to HTTP augmentation code on the
   Receiver capable of accepting and responding to Subscription Updates.

   At least the initial Post message must include the URI for the
   subscribed resource.  This URI can be retained for operational
   tracking and debugging use by the Receiver.

   After successful receipt of an initial Subscription Update for a
   particular Subscription, the Reciever should reply back with an HTTP
   status code of 201 (Created).  Further successful receipts should
   result in the return of code of 202 (Accepted).  At any point,
   receipt of any status codes from 300-510 with the exception of 408
   (Request Timeout) should result in the movement of the Subscription
   to the suspended state.  A sequential series of multiple 408
   exceptions should also drive the Subscription to a suspended state.

   Security on an HTTP client/Publisher can be strengthened by only
   accepting Response code feedback for recently initiated HTTP POSTs.

   Figure 2 depicts this message flow.

   If HTTP/2 transport is available to a Receiver, the Publisher should
   also:

   o  point individual Subscription Updates to a unique HTTP/2 stream
      for that Subscription,

   o  take any subscription-priority and provision it into the HTTP/2
      stream priority, and

   o  take any subscription-dependency and provision it into the HTTP/2
      stream dependency.

Internet-Draft                Restconf Push                   March 2016


3.2.  Subscription Multiplexing

   When pushed directly over HTTP/2, it is expected that each
   Subscription Update will be allocated a separate Stream.  This will
   enable multiplexing, and address issues of Head-of-line blocking with
   different priority Subscriptions.

   When pushed via Restconf over HTTP/2, different Subscriptions will
   not be mapped to independent HTTP/2 streams.  When Restconf specifies
   this mapping, support may be appended on top of this specification.

   With or without independent queueing of multiplexed subscriptions, it
   is possible that updates might be delivered in a different sequence
   than generated.  Reasons for this might include (but are not limited
   to):

   o  replay of pushed updates

   o  temporary loss of transport connectivity, with update buffering
      and different dequeuing priorities per Subscription

   o  population, marshalling and bundling of independent Subscription
      Updates, and

   o  parallel HTTP1.1 sessions

   Therefore each Subscription Update will include a microsecond level
   timestamp to ensure that a receiver understands the time when a that
   update was generated.  Use of this timestamp can give an indication
   of the state of objects at a Publisher when state-entangled
   information is received across different subscriptions.  The use of
   the latest Subscription Update timestamp for a particular object
   update can introduce errors.  So when state-entangled updates have
   inconsistent object values and temporally close timestamps, a
   Receiver might consider performing a 'get' to validate the current
   state of objects.

3.3.  Push Data Stream and Transport Mapping

   Transported updates will contain data for one or more Subscription
   Updates.  Each transported Subscription Update notification contains
   several parameters:

   o  A Subscription ID correlator

   o  Events or Data Nodes containing the updates.  (Note: These must be
      filtered per access control rules to contain only data that the
      subscriber is authorized to see.)

   o  A timestamp indication when the push update was generated on the
      Publisher.

3.3.1.  Subscription and Updates via Restconf

   Subscribers can dynamically learn whether a RESTCONF server supports
   various types of Event or Yang datastore subscription.  This is done
   by issuing an HTTP request OPTIONS, HEAD, or GET on the stream (**to
   do: Add name of capability discovery stream? **).  E.g.:

   GET /restconf/data/ietf-restconf-monitoring:restconf-state/
            streams/stream=yang-push HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/yang.data+xml

   If the server supports it, it may respond

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/yang.api+xml
   <stream xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-monitoring">
               <name>yang-push</name>
               <description>Yang push stream</description>
               <access>
                  <encoding>xml</encoding>
                  <location>https://example.com/streams/yang-push-xml
                  </location>
               </access>
               <access>
                  <encoding>json</encoding>
                  <location>https://example.com/streams/yang-push-json
                  </location>
               </access>
            </stream>

   (*** Also need to add an example of Event Stream ***) If the server
   does not support any form of subscription, it may respond

   HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
   Date: Mon, 25 Apr 2012 11:10:30 GMT
   Server: example-server

   Subscribers can determine the URL to receive updates by sending an
   HTTP GET request for the "location" leaf with the stream list
   entry.The stream to use for may be selected from the list provided in
   the capabilities exchange.  The location returned by the publisher
   can be used for the actual notification subscription.  Note that
   different encodings are supporting using different locations.  For
   example, he subscriber might send the following request:

Internet-Draft                Restconf Push                   March 2016


   GET /restconf/data/ietf-restconf-monitoring:restconf-state/
            streams/stream=yang-push/access=xml/location HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/yang.data+xml

   The publisher might send the following response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/yang.api+xml
      <location
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-monitoring">
           https://example.com/streams/yang-push-xml
      </location>

   To subscribe and start receiving updates, the subscriber can then
   send an HTTP GET request for the URL returned by the publisher in the
   request above.  The accept header must be "text/event-stream".  The
   publisher handles the connection as an event stream, using the Server
   Sent Events[W3C-20121211] transport strategy.

   The publisher MUST support as query parameters for a GET method on
   this resource all the parameters of a subscription.  The only
   exception is the encoding, which is embedded in the URI.  An example
   of this is:

   // subtree filter = /foo
   // periodic updates, every 5 seconds
   GET /mystreams/yang-push?subscription-id=my-sub&period=5&
              xpath-filter=%2Fex:foo[starts-with("bar"."some"]

   Should the publisher not support the requested subscription, it may
   reply:

        </datastore-contents>
     </notification>

   Or with the equivalent YANG over JSON encoding representation as
   defined in[yang-json] :

   {
     "ietf-restconf:notification": {
       "datastore-push:subscription-id": "my-sub",
       "eventTime": "2015-03-09T19:14:56Z",
       "datastore-push:datastore-contents": {
         "example-mod:foo": { "bar": "some_string" }
       }
     }
   }

   To modify a subscription, the subscriber issues another GET request
   on the provided URI using the same subscription-id as in the original
   request.  For example, to modify the update period to 10 seconds, the
   subscriber may send:

   GET /mystreams/yang-push?subscription-id=my-sub&period=10&
          subtree-filter=%2Ffoo'

   To delete a subscription, the subscriber issues a DELETE request on
   the provided URI using the same subscription-id as in the original
   request

   DELETE /mystreams/yang-push?subscription-id=my-sub

3.3.2.  Subscription and Updates directly via HTTP

   For any version of HTTP, the basic encoding will look as below.  It
   consists of a JSON representation wrapped in an HTTP header.

4.  Security Considerations

   Subscriptions could be used to intentionally or accidentally overload
   resources of a Publisher.  For this reason, it is important that the
   Publisher has the ability to prioritize the establishment and push of
   updates where there might be resource exhaust potential.  In
   addition, a server needs to be able to suspend existing subscriptions
   when needed.  When this occurs, the subscription status must be
   updated accordingly and the clients are notified.

   A Subscription could be used to retrieve data in subtrees that a
   client has not authorized access to.  Therefore it is important that
   data pushed via a Subscription is authorized equivalently with
   regular data retrieval operations.  Data being pushed to a client
   needs therefore to be filtered accordingly, just like if the data
   were being retrieved on-demand.  The Netconf Authorization Control
   Model [RFC6536] applies even though the transport is not NETCONF.

   One or more Publishers could be used to overwhelm a Receiver which
   doesn't even support subscriptions.  Therefore Updates MUST only be
   transmittable over Encrypted transports.  Clients which do not want
   pushed data need only terminate or refuse any transport sessions from
   the Publisher.

   One or more Publishers could overwhelm a Receiver which is unable to
   control or handle the volume of Updates received.  In deployments
   where this might be a concern, transports supporting per-subscription
   Flow Control and Prioritization (such as HTTP/2) should be selected.

   Another benefit is that a well-behaved Publisher implementation is
   that it is difficult to a Publisher to perform a DoS attack on a
   Receiver.  DoS attack protection comes from:

   o  the requirement for trust of a TLS session before publication,

   o  the need for an HTTP transport augmentation on the Receiver, and

   o  that the Publication process is suspended when the Receiver
      doesn't respond.

Appendix A.  Proxy YANG Subscription when the Subscriber and Receiver
             are different

   The properties of Dynamic and Configured Subscriptions can be
   combined to enable deployment models where the Subscriber and
   Receiver are different.  Such separation can be useful with some
   combination of:

   o  An operator doesn't want the subscription to be dependent on the
      maintenance of transport level keep-alives.  (Transport
      independence provides different scalability characteristics.)

   o  There is not a transport session binding, and a transient
      Subscription needs to survive in an environment where there is
      unreliable connectivity with the Receiver and/or Subscriber.

Internet-Draft                Restconf Push                   March 2016


   o  An operator wants the Publisher to include highly restrictive
      capacity management and Subscription security mechanisms outside
      of domain of existing operational or programmatic interfaces.

   To build a Proxy Subscription, first the necessary information must
   be signaled as part of the <establish-subscription>.  Using this set
   of Subscriber provided information; the same process described within
   section 3 will be followed.  There is one exception.  When an HTTP
   status code is 201 is received by the Publisher, it will inform the
   Subscriber of Subscription establishment success via its Restconf
   connection.

   After a successful establishment, if the Subscriber wishes to track
   the state of Receiver subscriptions, it may choose to place a
   separate on-change Subscription into the "Subscriptions" subtree of
   the YANG Datastore on the Publisher.

   Putting it all together, the message flow is:

        | Subscriber |          | Publisher |            | Receiver |

   necessary for an implementation of this specification, but will be
   useful to consider when considering the operational context.

B.1.  Call Home

   Pub/Sub implementations should have the ability to transparently
   incorporate lower layer technologies such as Call Home so that secure
   TLS connections are always originated from the Publisher.  There is a
   Restconf Call home function in [call-home].  For security reasons,
   this should be implemented when applicable.

B.2.  TLS Heartbeat

   Unlike NETCONF, HTTP sessions might not quickly allow a Subscriber to
   recognize when the communication path has been lost from the
   Publisher.  To recognize this, it is possible for a Receiver (usually
   the subscriber) to establish a TLS heartbeat [RFC6520].  In the case
   where a TLS heartbeat is included, it should be sent just from
   Receiver to Publisher.  Loss of the heartbeat should result in the
   Subscription being terminated with the Subscriber (even when the
   Subscriber and Receiver are different).  The Subscriber can then
   attempt to re-establish the subscription if desired.  If the
   Subscription remains active on the Publisher, future receipt of
   objects associated with that (or any other unknown) subscription ID
   should result in a <delete-subscription> being returned to the
   Publisher from the Receiver.
