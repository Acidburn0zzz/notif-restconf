    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mechanisms to support event subscription and push are defined in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>. Enhancements to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> which enable YANG datastore subscription and push are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/>. This document provides a transport specification for these protocols over RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/> and HTTP.  Driving these requirements is <xref target="RFC7923"/>.</t>

      <t>The streaming of notifications encapsulating the resulting information push can be done with either HTTP1.1 <xref target="RFC7231"/> or HTTP2 <xref target="RFC7540"/>.  </t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>The following terms use the definitions from <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>: configured subscription, dynamic subscription, event stream, notification message, publisher, receiver, subscriber, and subscription.</t>

      <t>Other terms reused include datastore, which is defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>, and HTTP2 stream which maps to the definition of "stream" within <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 2.</t>

    <section title="Dynamic Subscription">

      <t>This section provides specifics on how to establish and maintain dynamic subscriptions over HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2 via signaling messages transported over RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. Subscribing to event streams is accomplished in this way via a RESTCONF POST into RPCs defined within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> Section 2.4.   YANG datastore subscription is accomplished via augmentations to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> as described within <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Section 4.4.</t>

      <t>Common across all HTTP based dynamic subscriptions is that a POST needs to be made against a specific URI on the Publisher. Subscribers cannot pre-determine the URI against which a subscription might exist on a publisher, as the URI will only exist after the "establish-subscription" has been accepted. The subscription URI will be determined and sent as part of the response to the "establish-subscription", and a subsequent POST to this URI will be done in order to start the flow of notification messages back to the subscriber.  A subscription does not move to the active state as per Section 2.4.1. of <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> until the POST is received.</t>

      <section title="Transport Connectivity">

        <t>For a dynamic subscription, where an HTTP client session doesn't already exist, a new client session is initiated from the subscriber.  If the subscriber is unsure if HTTP2 is supported by the publisher, HTTP1.1 will be used for initial messages, and these messages will include an HTTP version upgrade request as per <xref target="RFC7230"/>, Section 6.7.  If a publisher response indicates that HTTP2 is supported, HTTP2 will be used between subscriber and publisher for future HTTP interactions as per <xref target="RFC7540"/>.</t>

        <t>A subscriber SHOULD establish the HTTP session over TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> in order to secure the content in transit.</t>

        <t>Without the involvement of additional protocols, neither HTTP1.1 nor HTTP2 sessions by themselves allow for a quick recognition of when the communication path has been lost with the publisher.  Where quick recognition of the loss of a publisher is required, a subscriber SHOULD connect over TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>, and use a TLS heartbeat <xref target="RFC6520"/> to track HTTP session continuity.  In the case where a TLS heartbeat is included, it should be sent just from receiver to publisher.  Loss of the heartbeat MUST result in any subscription related TCP sessions between those endpoints being torn down.  A subscriber can then attempt to re-establish.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Discovery">

        <t>Subscribers can learn what event streams a RESTCONF server supports by querying the "streams" container of ietf-subscribed-notification.yang. Subscribers can learn what datastores a RESTCONF server supports by following <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-nmda-restconf"/>. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="RESTCONF RPCs and HTTP Status Codes">

        <t>Specific HTTP responses codes as defined in <xref target="RFC7231"/> section 6 will indicate the result of RESTCONF RPC requests with publisher.  An HTTP status code of 200 is the proper response to any successful RPC defined within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/>.</t>

        <t>If a publisher fails to serve the RPC request for one of the reasons indicated in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> Section 2.4.6 or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Appendix A, this will be indicated by "406" status code transported in the HTTP response.</t>

        <t>When a "406" status code is returned, the RPC reply MUST include an "rpc-error" element per <xref target="RFC8040"/> Section 7.1 with the following parameter values:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>an "error-type" node of "application".</t>

          <t>an "error-tag" node of "operation-failed".</t>

          <t>an "error-app-tag" node with the value being a string that corresponds to an identity associated with the error, as defined in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> section 2.4.6 for general subscriptions, and <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Appendix A.1, for datastore subscriptions. The tag to use depends on the RPC for which the error occurred.  Viable errors for different RPCs are as follows:</t>

        </list></t>

        <figure align="left">
            <artwork><![CDATA[
         RPC                     select an identity with a base

         resynch-subscription    resynch-subscription-error
              ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Each error identity will be inserted as the "error-app-tag" using JSON encoding following the form &lt;modulename&gt;:&lt;identityname&gt;.  An example of such as valid encoding would be "ietf-subscribed-notifications:no-such-subscription".</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>In case of error responses to an "establish-subscription" or "modify-subscription" request there is the option of including an "error-info" node.  This node may contain hints for parameter settings that might lead to successful RPC requests in the future.   Following are the yang-data structures which may be returned:</t>
        </list></t>

        <figure align="left">
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      establish-subscription returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   establish-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      establish-subscription-datastore-error-info

      modify-subscription    returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   modify-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      modify-subscription-datastore-error-info

      The yang-data included within "error-info" SHOULD NOT include the
      optional leaf "error-reason", as such a leaf would be redundant
      with information that is already placed within the
      "error-app-tag".

      In case of an rpc error as a result of a "delete-subscription", a
      "kill-subscription", or a "resynch-subscription" request, no
      "error-info" needs to be included, as the "subscription-id" is
      the only RPC input parameter and no hints regarding this RPC input
      parameters need to be provided.
            ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Note that "error-path" does not need to be included with the "rpc-error" element, as subscription errors are generally not associated with nodes in the datastore but with the choice of RPC input parameters. </t>

      <section title="Call Flow for HTTP2">
        <t>Requests to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> augmented RPCs are sent on one or more HTTP2 streams indicated by (a) in <xref target="dyn-http2"/>.  A successful "establish-subscription" will result in an RPC response returned with both a subscription identifier which uniquely identifies a subscription, as well as a URI which uniquely identifies the location of subscription on the publisher.  This URI is defined via the "uri" leaf the Data Model in <xref target="YANG-module"/>.  </t>

        <t>An HTTP POST is then sent on a logically separate HTTP2 stream (b) to the URI on the publisher.  This initiates to initiate the flow of notification messages which are sent in HTTP Data frames as a response to the POST.  In the case below, a newly established subscription has its associated notification messages pushed over HTTP2 stream (7).  These notification messages are placed into a HTTP2 Data frame (see [RFC7540] Section 6.1).</t>

    <section title="Configured Subscription">

      <t>With a configured subscription, all information needed to establish a secure relationship with that receiver is available on the publisher. With this information, the publisher will establish a secure transport connection with the receiver and then begin pushing notification messages to the receiver. Since RESTCONF might not exist on the receiver, it is not desirable to require that subscribed content be pushed with any dependency on RESTCONF. Therefore in place of RESTCONF, an HTTP2 Client connection must be established with an HTTP2 Server located on the receiver. Notification messages will then be sent as part of an extended HTTP POST to the receiver.</t>

      <section title="Transport Connectivity">

        <t>Configured subscriptions MUST only be connected over HTTP2 via a client session initiated from the publisher.  Following are the conditions which MUST be met before establishing a new HTTP2 connection with a receiver:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>a configured subscription has a receiver in the connecting state as described in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>, section 2.5.1.,</t>
          <t>the transport configured for that subscription is HTTP2, </t>
          <t>there are state change notifications or notification messages pending for that receiver, and</t>
          <t>no HTTP2 transport session exists to that receiver,</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>If the above conditions are met, then the publisher MUST initiate a transport session via RESTCONF call home <xref target="RFC8071"/>, section 4.1 to that receiver.  HTTP2 only communications must be used as per <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 3.3 when the HTTP session over TLS [RFC5246]. and  <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 3.4 when transporting cleartext over TCP.  Note that a subscriber SHOULD establish over TLS in order to secure the content in transit.</t>


        <t>If the RESTCONF call home fails because the publisher receives receiver credentials which are subsequently declined per <xref target="RFC8071"/>, Section 4.1, step S5 authentication, then that receiver MUST be placed into the timeout state.</t>

        <t>If the call home fails to establish for any other reason, the publisher MUST NOT progress the receiver to the active state. Additionally, the publisher SHOULD place the receiver into the timeout state after a predetermined number of either failed call home attempts or remote transport session termination by the receiver.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Call Flow">

        <t>With HTTP2 connectivity established, a POST of each new "subscription-started" state change notification messages will be addressed to HTTP augmentation code on the receiver capable of accepting and acknowledging to subscription state change notifications.  Until the "HTTP 200 OK" at point (c) of <xref target="conf-HTTP2"/> for each the "subscription-started" state change notification, a publisher MUST NOT progress the receiver to the active state.   In other words, is at point (c) which indicates that the receiver is ready for the delivery of subscribed content. At this point a notification-messages including subscribed content may be placed onto an HTTP2 stream for that subscription.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management transports such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>.  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>.</t>

      <t>The one new data node introduced in this YANG module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to this data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t>Container: "/subscriptions"</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>"uri": leaf will show where subscribed resources might be located on a publisher.  Access control must be set so that only someone with proper access permissions, and perhaps even HTTP session has the ability to access this resource.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>One or more publishers of configured subscriptions could be used to overwhelm a receiver which doesn't even support subscriptions.  There are two protections needing support on a publisher.  First, notification messages for configured subscriptions MUST only be transmittable over encrypted transports.  Clients which do not want pushed content need only terminate or refuse any transport sessions from the publisher.  Second, the HTTP transport augmentation on the receiver must send an HTTP 200 OK to a subscription started notification before the publisher starts streaming any subscribed content.</t>

      <t>One or more publishers could overwhelm a receiver which is unable to control or handle the volume of Event Notifications received.  In deployments where this might be a concern, HTTP2 transport such as HTTP2) should be selected.</t>

      <t>The NETCONF Authorization Control Model <xref target="RFC6536"/> SHOULD be used to control and restrict authorization of subscription configuration.</t>

    <section title="RESTCONF over GRPC">

      <t>An initial goal for this document was to support <xref target="GRPC"/> transport seamlessly without any mapping or extra layering.  However there is an incompatibility of RESTCONF and GRPC.  RESTCONF uses HTTP GET, and GRPC uses HTTP2's POST rather than GET.  As GET is used across RESTCONF for things like capabilities exchange, a seamless mapping depends on specification changes outside the scope of this document.   If/when GRPC supports GET, or RESTCONF is updated to support POST, this should be revisited.  It is hoped that the resulting fix will be transparent to this document.</t>

    <section title="Examples">

      <t>This section is non-normative.  To allow easy comparison, this section mirrors the functional examples shown with NETCONF over XML within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notifications"/>.  In addition, HTTP2 vs HTTP1.1 headers are not shown as the contents of the JSON encoded objects are identical within.</t>

          <t>Note in the above that in the specific example above, modifying a configured subscription actually resulted in "subscription-started" notification.  And because of existing HTTP2 connectivity, no additional call home was needed.  Also note that if the edit of the configuration had impacted the filter, a separate modify-subscription would have been required for the original receiver.</t>
