    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mechanisms to support event subscription and push are defined in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>. Enhancements to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> which enable YANG datastore subscription and push are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/>. This document provides a transport specification for dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  Driving these requirements is <xref target="RFC7923"/>.</t>

      <t>The streaming of notifications encapsulating the resulting information push is done via the mechanism described in section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  </t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

      <t>The following terms use the definitions from <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>: dynamic subscription, event stream, notification message, publisher, receiver, subscriber, and subscription.</t>

      <t>Other terms reused include datastore, which is defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>, and HTTP2 stream which maps to the definition of "stream" within <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 2.</t>

    <section anchor="dyn-subs" title="Dynamic Subscriptions">

      <t>This section provides specifics on how to establish and maintain dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. Subscribing to event streams is accomplished in this way via RPCs defined within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> Section 2.4, the RPCs are done via RESTCONF POSTs. YANG datastore subscription is accomplished via augmentations to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> as described within <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Section 4.4.</t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC8040"/> Section 6.3, a GET needs to be made against a specific URI on the publisher. Subscribers cannot pre-determine the URI against which a subscription might exist on a publisher, as the URI will only exist after the "establish-subscription" RPC has been accepted. Therefore, the POST for the "establish-subscription" RPC replaces the GET request for the "location" leaf which is used in <xref target="RFC8040"/> to obtain the URI. The subscription URI will be determined and sent as part of the response to the "establish-subscription" RPC, and a subsequent GET to this URI will be done in order to start the flow of notification messages back to the subscriber.  A subscription does not move to the active state as per Section 2.4.1. of <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> until the GET is received. </t>

      <section title="Transport Connectivity">

        <t>For a dynamic subscription, where a RESTCONF session doesn't already exist, a new RESTCONF session is initiated from the subscriber.</t>

        <t>As stated in Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC8040"/>, a subscriber MUST establish the HTTP session over TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/> in order to secure the content in transit.</t>

        <t>Without the involvement of additional protocols, HTTP sessions by themselves do not allow for a quick recognition of when the communication path has been lost with the publisher.  Where quick recognition of the loss of a publisher is required, a subscriber SHOULD use a TLS heartbeat <xref target="RFC6520"/>, just from receiver to publisher, to track HTTP session continuity.</t>
        <t>Loss of the heartbeat MUST result in any subscription related TCP sessions between those endpoints being torn down.  A subscriber can then attempt to re-establish the dynamic subscription by using the procedure described in <xref target="dyn-subs"/>.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Discovery">

        <t>Subscribers can learn what event streams a RESTCONF server supports by querying the "streams" container of ietf-subscribed-notification.yang in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>. Support for the "streams" container of ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang in <xref target="RFC8040"/> is not required.</t>
        <t>Subscribers can learn what datastores a RESTCONF server supports by following <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-nmda-restconf"/>. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="RESTCONF RPCs and HTTP Status Codes">

        <t>Specific HTTP responses codes as defined in <xref target="RFC7231"/> section 6 will indicate the result of RESTCONF RPC requests with publisher.  An HTTP status code of 200 is the proper response to any successful RPC defined within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/>.</t>

        <t>If a publisher fails to serve the RPC request for one of the reasons indicated in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> Section 2.4.6 or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Appendix A, this will be indicated by "406" status code transported in the HTTP response.</t>

        <t>When a "406" status code is returned, the RPC reply MUST include an "rpc-error" element per <xref target="RFC8040"/> Section 7.1 with the following parameter values:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>an "error-type" node of "application".</t>

          <t>an "error-tag" node of "operation-failed".</t>

          <t>an "error-app-tag" node with the value being a string that corresponds to an identity associated with the error, as defined in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> section 2.4.6 for general subscriptions, and <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Appendix A.1, for datastore subscriptions. The tag to use depends on the RPC for which the error occurred.  Viable errors for different RPCs are as follows:</t>

        </list></t>

        <figure align="left">
            <artwork><![CDATA[
         RPC                     select an identity with a base
         ----------------------  ------------------------------
         establish-subscription  establish-subscription-error
         modify-subscription     modify-subscription-error
         delete-subscription     delete-subscription-error
         kill-subscription       kill-subscription-error
         resynch-subscription    resynch-subscription-error
              ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Each error identity will be inserted as the "error-app-tag" using JSON encoding following the form &lt;modulename&gt;:&lt;identityname&gt;.  An example of such as valid encoding would be "ietf-subscribed-notifications:no-such-subscription".</t>

        <t>In case of error responses to an "establish-subscription" or "modify-subscription" request there is the option of including an "error-info" node.  This node may contain hints for parameter settings that might lead to successful RPC requests in the future.   Following are the yang-data structures which may be returned:</t>

        <figure align="left">
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      establish-subscription returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   establish-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      establish-subscription-datastore-error-info

      modify-subscription    returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   modify-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      modify-subscription-datastore-error-info

      The yang-data included within "error-info" SHOULD NOT include the
      optional leaf "error-reason", as such a leaf would be redundant
      with information that is already placed within the
      "error-app-tag".

      In case of an rpc error as a result of a "delete-subscription", a
      "kill-subscription", or a "resynch-subscription" request, no
      "error-info" needs to be included, as the "subscription-id" is
      the only RPC input parameter and no hints regarding this RPC input
      parameters need to be provided.
            ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Note that "error-path" <xref target="RFC8040"/> does not need to be included with the "rpc-error" element, as subscription errors are generally associated with the choice of RPC input parameters. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Call Flow for Server-Sent Events (SSE)">
        <t>The call flow is defined in <xref target="dyn-sse"/>.  The logical connections denoted by (a) and (b) can be a TCP connection or an HTTP2 stream (multiple HTTP2 streams can be carried in one TCP connection). Requests to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> augmented RPCs are sent on a connection indicated by (a).  A successful "establish-subscription" will result in an RPC response returned with both a subscription identifier which uniquely identifies a subscription, as well as a URI which uniquely identifies the location of subscription on the publisher (b). This URI is defined via the "uri" leaf the Data Model in <xref target="YANG-module"/>. </t>

        <t>An HTTP GET is then sent on a separate logical connection (b) to the URI on the publisher.  This initiates the publisher to initiate the flow of notification messages which are sent in SSE <xref target="W3C-20150203"/> as a response to the GET.</t>

Event records based on this specification which are generated by the publisher might appear as:</t>

      <figure align="center"

      <t>Suppose a subscriber wanted to establish a subscription which only passes instances of event records where there is a "checksum-error" as part of a VRRP protocol event.  Also assume the publisher places such event records into the NETCONF stream.  To get a continuous series of matching event records, the subscriber might request the application of an XPath filter against the NETCONF stream.  An "establish-subscription" RPC to meet this objective might be:</t>

And suppose later a subscriber decided they wanted to broaden this subscription cover to all VRRP protocol events (i.e., not just those with a "checksum error").  The subscriber might attempt to modify the subscription in a way which replaces the XPath filter with a subtree filter which sends all VRRP protocol events to a subscriber. Such a "modify-subscription" RPC might look like:</t>
