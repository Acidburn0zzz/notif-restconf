    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mechanisms to support event subscription and push are defined in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>. Enhancements to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> which enable YANG datastore subscription and push are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/>. This document provides a transport specification for dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  Requirements for these mechanisms are captured in <xref target="RFC7923"/>.</t>

      <t>The streaming of notifications encapsulating the resulting information push is done via the mechanism described in section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>The following terms use the definitions from <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>: dynamic subscription, event stream, notification message, publisher, receiver, subscriber, and subscription.</t>

      <t>Other terms reused include datastore, which is defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>, and HTTP2 stream which maps to the definition of "stream" within <xref target="RFC7540"/>, Section 2.</t>

    <section anchor="dyn-subs" title="Dynamic Subscriptions">

      <t>This section provides specifics on how to establish and maintain dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. Subscribing to event streams is accomplished in this way via RPCs defined within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> Section 2.4. The RPCs are done via RESTCONF POSTs. YANG datastore subscription is accomplished via augmentations to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> as described within <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Section 4.4.</t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC8040"/> Section 6.3, a GET needs to be made against a specific URI on the publisher. Subscribers cannot pre-determine the URI against which a subscription might exist on a publisher, as the URI will only exist after the "establish-subscription" RPC has been accepted. Therefore, the POST for the "establish-subscription" RPC replaces the GET request for the "location" leaf which is used in <xref target="RFC8040"/> to obtain the URI. The subscription URI will be determined and sent as part of the response to the "establish-subscription" RPC, and a subsequent GET to this URI will be done in order to start the flow of notification messages back to the subscriber.  A subscription does not move to the active state as per Section 2.4.1. of <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> until the GET is received. </t>

      <section title="Transport Connectivity">

        <t>For a dynamic subscription, where a RESTCONF session doesn't already exist, a new RESTCONF session is initiated from the subscriber.</t>

        <t>As stated in Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC8040"/>, a subscriber MUST establish the HTTP session over TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/> in order to secure the content in transit.</t>

        <t>Without the involvement of additional protocols, HTTP sessions by themselves do not allow for a quick recognition of when the communication path has been lost with the publisher.  Where quick recognition of the loss of a publisher is required, a subscriber SHOULD use a TLS heartbeat <xref target="RFC6520"/>, just from subscriber to publisher, to track HTTP session continuity.</t>
        <t>Loss of the heartbeat MUST result in any subscription related TCP sessions between those endpoints being torn down.  A subscriber can then attempt to re-establish the dynamic subscription by using the procedure described in <xref target="SSE"/>.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Discovery">

        <t>Subscribers can learn what event streams a RESTCONF server supports by querying the "streams" container of ietf-subscribed-notification.yang in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>. Support for the "streams" container of ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang in <xref target="RFC8040"/> is not required. In the case when the RESTCONF binding specified by this document is used to convey the "streams" container from ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang (i.e., that feature is supported), any event streams contained therein are also expected to be present in the "streams" container of ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang.</t>
        <t>Subscribers can learn what datastores a RESTCONF server supports by following Section 2 of <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-nmda-restconf"/>. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="RESTCONF RPCs and HTTP Status Codes">

        <t>Specific HTTP responses codes as defined in <xref target="RFC7231"/> section 6 will indicate the result of RESTCONF RPC requests with the publisher.  An HTTP status code of 200 is the proper response to any successful RPC defined within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/>.</t>

        <t>If a publisher fails to serve the RPC request for one of the reasons indicated in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> Section 2.4.6 or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> Appendix A, this will be indicated by an appropriate error code, as shown below, transported in the HTTP response.</t>

        <t>When an HTTP error code is returned, the RPC reply MUST include an "rpc-error" element per <xref target="RFC8040"/> Section 7.1 with the following parameter values:
        <list style="symbols">
      <t>an "error-type" node of "application".</t>
      <t>an "error-tag" node with the value being a string that corresponds to an identity associated with the error.  This "error-tag" will come from one of two places.  Either it will correspond to the error identities within <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> section 2.4.6 for general subscription errors:</t>

        <t>In case of error responses to an "establish-subscription" or "modify-subscription" request there is the option of including an "error-info" node.  This node may contain hints for parameter settings that might lead to successful RPC requests in the future.   Following are the yang-data structures which may be returned:</t>

      target: event stream   modify-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      modify-subscription-datastore-error-info

      The yang-data included within "error-info" SHOULD NOT include the
      optional leaf "reason", as such a leaf would be redundant
      with information that is already placed within the
      "error-app-tag".

      In case of an rpc error as a result of a "delete-subscription", a
      "kill-subscription", or a "resync-subscription" request, no
      "error-info" needs to be included, as the "subscription-id" is
      the only RPC input parameter and no hints regarding this RPC input
      parameters need to be provided.

        </figure>

        <t>Note that "error-path" <xref target="RFC8040"/> does not need to be included with the "rpc-error" element, as subscription errors are generally associated with the choice of RPC input parameters. </t>

      <section anchor="SSE" title="Call Flow for Server-Sent Events">
        <t>The call flow for Server-Sent Events (SSE) is defined in <xref target="dyn-sse"/>.  The logical connections denoted by (a) and (b) can be a TCP connection or an HTTP2 stream (multiple HTTP2 streams can be carried in one TCP connection). Requests to <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push"/> augmented RPCs are sent on a connection indicated by (a).  A successful "establish-subscription" will result in an RPC response returned with both a subscription identifier which uniquely identifies a subscription, as well as a URI which uniquely identifies the location of subscription on the publisher (b). This URI is defined via the "uri" leaf the Data Model in <xref target="YANG-module"/>. </t>

        <t>An HTTP GET is then sent on a separate logical connection (b) to the URI on the publisher.  This signals the publisher to initiate the flow of notification messages which are sent in SSE <xref target="W3C-20150203"/> as a response to the GET. There can not be 2 or more simultaneous GET requests on a subscription URI: any GET request received while there is a current GET request on the same URI MUST be rejected with HTTP error code 409.</t>
        
        <t>As described in <xref target="RFC8040"/> Section 6.4, RESTCONF servers SHOULD NOT send the "event" or "id" fields in the SSE event notifications.</t>

        <t>Additional requirements for dynamic subscriptions over SSE include:</t>

          <t>All subscription state notifications from a publisher MUST be returned in a separate SSE message used by the subscription to which the state change refers.</t>
          <t>Subscription RPCs MUST NOT use the connection currently providing notification messages for that subscription.</t>
          <t>In addition to an RPC response for a "modify-subscription" RPC traveling over (a), a "subscription-modified" state change notification MUST be sent within (b).  This allows the receiver to know exactly when, within the stream of events, the new terms of the subscription have been applied to the notification messages.  See arrow (c).</t>
          <t>In addition to any required access permissions (e.g., NACM), RPCs modify-subscription, resync-subscription and
delete-subscription SHOULD only be allowed by the same RESTCONF username <xref target="RFC8040"/> which invoked establish-subscription. Such a restriction generally serves to preserve users' privacy, but exceptions might be made for administrators that may need to modify or delete other users' subscriptions.</t>
          <t>The kill-subscription RPC can be invoked by any RESTCONF username with the required administrative permissions.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>take the "weighting" leaf node in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>, and copy it into the HTTP2 stream weight, <xref target="RFC7540"/> section 5.3, and </t>

        <t>take any existing subscription "dependency", as specified by the "dependency" leaf node in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications"/>,  and use the HTTP2 stream for the parent subscription as the HTTP2 stream dependency, <xref target="RFC7540"/> section 5.3.1, of the dependent subscription.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management transports such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>.  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

      <t>The one new data node introduced in this YANG module may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to this data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t>Container: "/subscriptions"</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>"uri": leaf will show where subscribed resources might be located on a publisher.  Access control must be set so that only someone with proper access permissions, i.e., the same RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/> user credentials which invoked the corresponding "establish-subscription", has the ability to access this resource.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>The subscription URI is implementation specific and is encrypted via the use of TLS. Therefore, even if an attacker succeeds in guessing the subscription URI, a RESTCONF username <xref target="RFC8040"/> with the required administrative permissions must be used to be able to access or modify that subscription. It is recommended that the subscription URI values not be easily predictable.</t>
      <t>The access permission considerations for the RPCs modify-subscription, resync-subscription, delete-subscription and kill-subscription are described in <xref target="SSE"/>.</t>
      <t>If a buggy or compromised RESTCONF subscriber sends a number of "establish-subscription" requests, then these subscriptions accumulate and may
    use up system resources.  In such a situation, the publisher MAY also suspend or terminate a subset of the active
    subscriptions from that RESTCONF subscriber in order to reclaim resources and preserve normal operation for the other subscriptions.

    <section title="Filter Example">
    
      <t>This section provides an example which illustrate the method of filtering event record contents.  The example is based on the YANG notification "vrrp-protocol-error-event" as defined per the ietf-vrrp.yang module within <xref target="RFC8347"/>.  Event records based on this specification which are generated by the publisher might appear as:</t>

      <figure align="center" 
              anchor="VRRP-notification" 
              title="RFC 8347 (VRRP) - Example Notification">

      data: {
      data:   "ietf-restconf:notification" : {
      data:     "eventTime" : "2018-09-14T08:22:33.44Z",
      data:     "ietf-vrrp:vrrp-protocol-error-event" : {
      data:       "protocol-error-reason" : "checksum-error"
      data:     }
      data:   }
      data: }
         ]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Suppose a subscriber wanted to establish a subscription which only passes instances of event records where there is a "checksum-error" as part of a VRRP protocol event.  Also assume the publisher places such event records into the NETCONF stream.  To get a continuous series of matching event records, the subscriber might request the application of an XPath filter against the NETCONF stream.  An "establish-subscription" RPC to meet this objective might be:</t>

              anchor="VRRP-XPATH" 
              title="Establishing a subscription error reason via XPath">

      <t>Suppose the "establish-subscription" in <xref target="VRRP-XPATH"/> was accepted. And suppose later a subscriber decided they wanted to broaden this subscription cover to all VRRP protocol events (i.e., not just those with a "checksum error").  The subscriber might attempt to modify the subscription in a way which replaces the XPath filter with a subtree filter which sends all VRRP protocol events to a subscriber. Such a "modify-subscription" RPC might look like:</t>
